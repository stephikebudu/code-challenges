# Code Challenges
## Start Here
This repo hosts [Stephany](https://stephikebudu.vercel.app/about)'s solutions to the weekly code challenges posted in the [YWC Code Club](#the-ywc-code-club)

## Project Architecture
I have organized each challenge into folders, numbered according to the sequence in which they've been posted in the code club's discord channel. Each folder contains a `CHALLENGE.md` file which contains the problem question and the file(s) for my solution to the problem. You can find the pseudocode at the top of each file to better undertand my approach/solution to the problem. I also try to document the code, lol I lied, I actually almost never document my code. I probably should do better with code documentation, but hey all programmers don't enjoy documenting code...right? At least, I hope so.

## Technology
I solved each challenge using both JavaScript and Python (since the [pizza price challenge](006-pizza-price)). Earlier challenges are solved in only JavaScript. Each challenge is language agnostic, see the `CHALLENGE.md` file in each folder and solve in you programming language of choice if you feel up for it!

## The YWC Code Club
YWC is an abbreviation for [Young Women Code](https://www.youngwomencode.org), a non-governmental organization I have been volunteering for since its inception in 2023. The organization's mission is to bridge the gender gap in tech by isnpiring and sponsoring the next generation of female tech leaders. I pioneered and currently lead the code club at Young Women Code (known as the [YWC Code Club]([https://www.youngwomencode.org](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUlALCTv1_wpGtADNvQEqiadn22_PGEkBRyppXtP_tSgEgYg/viewform))) to create a platform where members of the community can learn to code, improve problem-solving skills, be inspired, and thrive amongst peers.

I post challenges and host live solution calls weekly in the YWC Code Club, where I explain my thought process and do a walk-through of my code as well as assist with any blockers community members have. We also discuss code, career and chat sometimes. Discord is currently our primary platform.

## Acknowledgements
I do not come up with these problem questions (just the solutions), I appreciate the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) team and community for the problem questions and invaluable platform that has been very instrumental to my development as a software engineer. Their (now closed) code-challenges Discord channel was the primary reference resource for problem questions when the YWC Code Club launched in April, 2025, and for that I'm immensely grateful.
