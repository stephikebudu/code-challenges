# Code Challenges
## Start Here
This repo hosts [Stephany](https://stephikebudu.vercel.app/about)'s solutions to the weekly code challenges posted in the [YWC Code Club](#the-ywc-code-club)

## Architeecture
I have organized each challenge into folders, numbered according to the sequence in which they've been posted in the code club's discord channel. Each folder contains a `CHALLENGE.md` file which contains the problem qustion and the file(s) for my solution to the problem. You can find th pseudocode at the top of th file to better undertand my approach/solution to the problem. I also try to document the code, lol I lied, I actually almost never document my code except I absolutely need it to stop "thinking all over the place". I should probably do better code documentation, but hey all programmers don't enjoy documenting code...right? At least, I hope so.

## The YWC Code Club
YWC is an abbreviation for [Young Women Code](https://www.youngwomencode.org) which is a non-govermental organization I volunteer for since its year of inception (2023). The organization's mission is to bridge the gender gap in tech by isnpiring and sponsoring the next generation of female tech leaders. I pioneered and currently lead the code club at Young Women Code (known as the [YWC Code Club](https://www.youngwomencode.org)) to create a platform where members of the community can learn to code, improve problem-solving skills, be inspired, and thrive amongst peers.

I post challenges and host live solution calls weekly in the [Young Women Code](https://www.youngwomencode.org), where I explain my thought process and do a walk-through of my solution as well as explain (or at lat attempt to unblock) any blockers community members have. We also discuss code (and chat sometimes). Discord is currently our primary platform. Click [here]() to join the [Young Women Code](https://www.youngwomencode.org).
