# Pizza Price
When you're shopping for pizza, you'll often see the size (diameter) of the pizza and the total price, but you can't win the bargain hunting game without finding the **price per square inch**!

**Challenge:** Given two numbers, the first representing the diameter of the pizza (in inches), and the second representing the cost of the pizza (in USD), return the price per square inch of pizza. You should return a number with no more than **two** decimal places.

**Test cases:**
- With `7` and `4.30`, return `0.11`
- With `9` and `5.95`, return `0.09`
- With `12` and `7.90`, return `0.07`
