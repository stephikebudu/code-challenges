# Tribonacci
A Tribonacci sequence works just like the Fibonacci sequence, except instead of the sum of the last two numbers, you take the sum of the last three!

**Here is your challenge**: Given an array containing the first three numbers of your sequence, and a number representing the length of your sequence, return a list of all numbers in that sequence up to the length.

**Test cases**:
With `[0, 1, 1]` and `10`, return `[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81]`
With `[1, 2, 3]` and `15`, return `[ 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, 68, 125, 230, 423, 778, 1431, 2632, 4841 ]`
With `[123, 456, 789]` and `20`, return `[123,456,789,1368,2613,4770,8751,16134,29655,54540,100329,184524,339393,624246,1148163,2111802,3884211,7144176,13140189,24168576]`
