**Challenge:** Given a number of miles ran, and a time in `"MM:SS"` (minutes:seconds) it took to run those miles, return a string for the average time it took to run each mile in the format `"MM:SS"`. Add leading zeros when needed.

**Test cases:**
- `milePace(3, "24:00")` should return `"08:00"`.
- `milePace(1, "06:45")` should return `"06:45"`.
- `milePace(2, "07:00")` should return `"03:30"`.
- `milePace(26.2, "120:35")` should return `"04:36"`.
