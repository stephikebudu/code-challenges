# Pricify
I'm opening a trading card shop! But the cashier I hired is very slow, and has trouble making change. To help take the burden off of her, I'd like to ensure that all of my products are priced at either flat dollar amounts, or fifty cent amounts.

**Challenge:** Given the market price of a product, return the price I should sell the product at (rounded to the nearest 0.5 step).

**Test cases:**
With `4.2` return `4`,
With `4.25` return `4.5`,
With `4.3` return `4.5`,
With `4.6` return `4.5`,
With `4.75` return `5`,
With `4.8` return `5`
